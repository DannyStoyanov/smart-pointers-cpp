# Overfiew

My own implementation of the unique_ptr which is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes of that object when the unique_ptr goes out of scope. The original class is part of C++ memory header: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr
